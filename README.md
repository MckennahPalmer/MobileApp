# Overview

This is my Module 2 for my Applied Programming class. I decided to make a mobile app using Kotlin and Java, since I learned Kotlin for my Module 1.
I thought it would be great to further apply what I learned so I could get better at Kotlin, and I mostly made Web apps before.

It was suppose to be a Jump Scare app, but it is very simple in design because what I originally envisioned was a bit more complex than I imagined.
So you will see a home page that says Hello world! with a next button. You hit the button and the second page that pops up will hold the jump scare image.
There is a settings and email button that are unfinished but still interactive.

My purpose in doing this was to practise Kotlin and get more experience.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Android Studios and the coding environment. I also used git and github, along with gradle. 

I used Kotlin and Java as my programming languages.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add sound effects and improve image quality
* Make the transition more smooth and instanteous. A scanner instead of a button that say next
* More user interaction and finish the ones in progress
